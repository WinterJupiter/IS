Emotet is one of the most disruptive malware of recent times. Email campaigns using Emotet are very periodic, with breaks of complete silence between attacks. Emotetâ€˜s highest activity was seen in December 2019 and February 2020. It then  hibernated for nearly half a year. In the second half of the year, we saw campaigns on and off though August, September and October. Since then, we have not seen a new wave of phishing emails.
